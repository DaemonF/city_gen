the ultimate interface:

- polygon/face
  - each pt connected by a "line" (straight or some kind of curve)

for both building bases and walls





TODO
- from a polygon, produce another one to go on top
  - discover a rectangle inside, then start over with same corners?
  - handle the case where some lines get crunched in
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1109536/an-algorithm-for-inflating-deflating-offsetting-buffering-polygons
- easy way to specify polygon styles
  - different cuts per corner?
  - only cut some corners?
  - make sure cuts aren't overlapping
  - another cut-corner style with line segments directly between the cuts
    - requires a better debug; ascii needs bresenham
- specify an entire building (walls and base)
